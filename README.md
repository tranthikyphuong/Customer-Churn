*Customer churn prediction is a critical aspect of business management, particularly for industries like telecommunications, internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services. It involves understanding and addressing customer attrition, which refers to the loss of clients or customers.*

**2. Problem Statement:**

*For businesses in these sectors, measuring customer attrition is a vital business metric. This is because retaining an existing customer is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring a new one. As a result, these companies often have customer service branches dedicated to re-engaging customers who are considering leaving. This is because the long-term value of recovered customers far outweighs that of newly acquired ones.*
*To address customer churn, predictive analytics comes into play, churn prediction models to assess the likelihood of customers leaving. These models prioritize a small list of potential defectors, enabling businesses to concentrate their customer retention efforts on those who are most at risk of churning.*
